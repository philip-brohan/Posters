I like the climate stripes (I'm not the only one) but I want to see more details. So this version's less well suited to painting on the side of a bus, but does give a tremendous amount of information on climate variability and change. It's also a fast and effective way to demonstrate both the power and limitations of a climate model.

The cartoon images were drawn for me by `google Gemini <https://g.co/gemini/share/097a58de39bf>`_.

Here's the `final PowerPoint file (14Mb) <../../_static/Show_more_stripes.pptx>`_.

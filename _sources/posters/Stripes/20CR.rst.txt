Warming Stripes (20CRv3 version)
================================

.. note::
   This idea has been developed into the `generalised Stripes <http://brohan.org/Stripes/index.html>`_ .

The `warming stripes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warming_stripes>`_ are a spectacularly successful tool for communicating climate change - can we build on them by making more complex versions containing more information? In particular, I'd like to make an equivalent plot that used temperatures resolved in time and space - this would show the large-scale change in the context of smaller-scale variability, much closer to climate change as we experience it.

Hourly data proved a bit much, but we can go to monthly: The vertical axis of this plot is latitude (90S to 90N at 1 degree resolution), the horizontal axis is time (Jan 1836 to Dec 2015, at 1 month resolution), each vertical line is at a randomly sampled 1-degree of longitude. Colour gives temperature anomaly (w.r.t 1900-1950 climatology). Data are from `20CR version 3. <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.20thC_ReanV3.html>`_

Note that, unlike the original warming stripes, this visualization says more about the uncertainties and biases in the data set construction than about actual climate.

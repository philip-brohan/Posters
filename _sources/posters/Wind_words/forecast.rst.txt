Edited forecast text
====================

Hand edited from :doc:`original <forecast_raw>`. Mostly just spit into shorter lines on punctuation
But also a few lines have been selected for highlighting. These lines have been prepended by a string like "[52.5,-12,6.5]", the three numbers are the latitude and longitude to start drawing the string, and the font size to use. (For non highlighted lines, position and size are allocated automatically).

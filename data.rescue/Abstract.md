# Reducing uncertainty by data rescue

The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) has demonstrated the power of reanalysis as a tool for inferring long-term climate variability and change. In particular, it is an effective user of the limited historical observations record, adding value to the available observations.
A key virtue of 20CR is that it is an ensemble product, and the distribution across the ensemble is an invaluable measure of uncertainty. Using the relative entropy of the ensemble with respect to a climatolological distribution shows clearly the time and space variation of the reanalysis skill. The dominant factor in 
the analysis skill is the availability of nearby observations for assimilation - making new observations available by systematic data rescue can generate large improvements in 20CR.

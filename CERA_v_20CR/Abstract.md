# Effect of assimilating sparse weather observations in two different ensemble reanalyses

The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) and the CERA-20C coupled climate reanalysis are both ensemble products assimilating only surface observations. They assimilate almost the same set of atmospheric observations, but CERA uses more information from each observation, assimilating marine winds in addition to the surface pressures used by 20CR.
Comparison of the two ensembles, in a time and place where observations coverage is sparse, demonstrates the relationship between individual observations and analysis precision, and shows the effect of the different assimilation choices.

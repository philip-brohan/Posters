# Visual analysis

One of the strengths of reanalyses is in their detail - they describe the complex structure of the atmosphere, showing the behaviour of many variables on a range of space and time scales. This strength makes them difficult to appreciate and inter-compare - it is hard to capture their value and accuracy in simple numerical metrics.
Modern scientific visualisation methods offer a powerful tool for analysis and comparison. Careful choice of colour and structure allows plots capturing spatial detail for several variables simultaniously, and video shows their time-evolution.

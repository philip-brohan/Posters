Eye-candy: Philip's posters
===========================

I know how to give a good talk, but sometimes I'm asked for a poster instead, and I don't know how to make a good poster, so I'm experimenting.

This is a set of visualisations designed to be printed out as large posters. Some of them are complete scientific posters and have been used at conferences or meetings, others are just large pictures.

So far my experiments have been unsuccessful: I want to make a poster that people will spontaniously stop and look at, and which communicates its message to most such readers. None of my posters have achieved this (I think most people don't notice them at all, they certainly don't stop and engage). Why is this so hard?

===================================

Originally from `<https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/print/shipping-forecast>`_ retrieved with help from `the wayback machine <https://archive.org/>`_.

Note that the forecast is `Crown Copyright <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/policies/legal#licences>`_. The shipping forecast is `archived by the Met Office <https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/index.php?name=SO_242fc75e-c73f-4ed9-aedb-9d38e6d4ee58>`_ and should be accessed from there where possible - I include it here only because the official archive isn't up to 2024-12-07 yet.
